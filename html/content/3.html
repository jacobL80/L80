                    This is an infographic about a video game, so its layout and design should be fun and interesting to reflect the subject matter.

					A palette of vibrant and slightly pastel-like colors was chosen to reflect the fun and whimsical nature of the game. Brown was selected as a primary background color to reflect the game's setting of a mountain-top forest.

					Based on peer feedback, the pie chart was determined to be more compelling in displaying this data, as one could more easily compare ranks to one another but also get a better feel for what its quantity was relative to the whole player base.

					<h4>Classes by Position</h4>
					On personal review, the rigid lines felt unnatural in this part of the infographic, so I opted for more of a diagram-based graphic, which I felt gave the piece more of a "fun" feel.

					<h4>Count by Class</h4>
					It became clear after peer review that the comparative bubble chart was not a satisfying way of comparing the champion class count, so I instead opted for a more simple visualization, which overall improved the piece by emphasizing just how many options there were per grouping and gave more meaning to the total count.

					<h4>Release Dates</h4>
					In another personal review decision, I changed the timeline to have a more coiled effect to both better take up space on the infographic, but also to make viewing what was one of the more simple visualizations more interesting by inviting the viewer to follow the cords turns.
