                    <h4>Sleek</h4>
                    As a document aggregate, the website should take a back seat to the actual content and have a "behind-the-scenes" feel to its design.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Simple</h4>
                    The website's design should not get in the way of getting to the documents a user wishes to view. It needs to be as simple and direct as possible.

					<h4>Iconography</h4>
					Early into the design phase, I attempted to more heavily focus the portal on iconography, especially on the landing page. This was met with mixed results from the team, which led to me de-emphasizing iconography across the board.

					<h4>Progression</h4>
					After toning down the iconography in the landing page's buttons, the team decided that including some symbolic icons in the background would improve the feel of the site. Icons that symbolized servers, dashboards, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing were chosen among several as best fitting the contents of the NPPI portal.

					<h4>Final Mock Ups</h4>
					After further tweaking, the designs were (at the time) finalized to the versions seen to the right. After being live as shown for a month or so, the NPPI team made requests to slightly alter a number of design choices, which can be seen reflected in the changes below.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 modal-text">The NPPI Portal was my first big project at T-Mobile, and working through it alongside 2 front end development interns helped me learn a lot about the design process in the tech industry. As a designer, I was working for the first time as the design lead on a project, which gave me the creative freedom to take this project in any direction I saw fit initially. As we continued to nail down what did and didn't work in my design mock ups, I became more proficient at not only creating better looking and more readable designs, but getting a better feel for the constituents needs, both of which I feel are well reflected in the projects following this one at T-Mobile.</div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 modal-text">If I were to revisit this project in the future, there are a number of changes I would make to the design in order to further improve it with the knowledge I have gained since working on it. For example, There are a few places where the text is not very readable, such as the title on the landing page.The navigation bar feels cluttered at times, as well, and on reflection I would want to either better space out the options, or align them differently to better separate them.</div>
