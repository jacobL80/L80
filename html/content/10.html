                    These posters are supposed to grab the attention of people passing by them, so they need an interesting design to get them to even look at it in the first place.

                    Above all, these posters should be fun and interesting to look at, to encourage people to talk about them and pass on their info via word-of-mouth.

					<h4>T-Mobile Symbology</h4>
					In order to make a clear connection to T-Mobile, a number of symbolic options have been employed to connect the two displayed events to the company. In the first poster, the table is in the shape of T-Mobile's iconic "T" logo, and in the second, one of the buildings present at the company's Bellevue headquarters is depicted. Both posters also make use of T-Mobile's shade of magenta, and their own font "Tele-Grotesk".

					<h4>Clearness</h4>
					Both posts have a visual hierarchy in their texts in order of importance-- in the first poster, "POTLUCK" is the largest text, informing readers quickly that the poster is about an upcoming event. The second poster, on the other hand, has "Engineering Intelligence & Analytics" as its largest text letting readers know it will be about that team within the company. Both posters use white text on a magenta background, making the text very easy to read from afar. Verbal content has been kept to a minimum in order to maximize the posters' affect on readers who will likely not actually stop to read them, ensuring quick visual consumption.

					<h4>Intrigue</h4>
					For those who look more closely, a number of unneccesary but fun details were added to allow for further interest past initial viewings, and to encourage discussion about each poster. Many minute details, such as sandwich fixings in the first poster, or the activities of tiny people in the second poster, add a more fun and whimsical nature to an internal workplace that can feel lacking in these feelings.
