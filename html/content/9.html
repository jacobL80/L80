                    <h4>Cleaner and Simpler</h4>
                    The previous version was made in Tableau and was very cluttered and complicated to use. A revamp to the application should simplify things down as much as possible while retaining as many features as possible.

                    <h4>Hierarchy</h4>
                    DPPI's original program lacked a clear and cohesive hierarchy, making it very intimidating for new users to learn. This update should both be simple enough for the standard user to pick up, and also have an easy to understand user guide to teach those who can't.

                    <h4>Interactive</h4>
                    The program should retain and improve upon the ability to quickly and easily change search functions, sort by any number of KPIs, and change graph and chart types at will with minimal wait time.

                    <h4>Expandable</h4>
                    As a complete remake of its former version, the new DPPI application needs to create a solid base upon which the team will continually iterate for the forseeable future with more features, more KPIs, and other quality of life updates.

					<h4>Early Design</h4>
					Early into the designing stage for the program's visual update, I settled onto the idea of a vertical control panel that would house most of the data analytic tools. By removing most of the clutter from the header menu, users would feel less overwhelmed on initial page load, and filter options would be more clearly defined from other menu options (such as swapping between chart views, toggling table visibility, and accessing the user guide). It was also agreed upon that the filter menu would be toggleable, so users who didn't plan on changing their current view could hide the menu, greatly simplifying the current display.

					<h4>Filter Menu</h4>
					The Filter menu consolidates all options that in some way change the data presented in the graph and table into a single menu. It quickly allows for the changing of date selection, KPI type, location, and a number of other dimensions (such as device type or brand). The menu is drill down, so as options are selected, ones that are not compatible with it are removed from the remaining options. Users can hide the menu after performing their search to keep it from getting in the way of their data analytics.

					<h4>Graph, Table, and Legend</h4>
					The primary component of DPPI, the graph and table display the relevant data based on the search criteria supplied by the user. It can sort and display the data based on a number of grouping options, such as brand, device, market, and more. All 3 elements support hovering for more information-- hovering on thegraph displays that bar's details, and hovering on an option in the legend or table will highlight all of the bars of that type on the graph, making it easy to find the data a user needs when there are many options displayed at once.
