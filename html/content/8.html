                    The clients for this template requested responsiveness, so it should not only be smooth in its transitions, but also seamlessly transition to a mobile version as needed.

Having a pure HTML solution was no longer feasible, so the design needed to be completely changed to reflect that.</div>

					<h4>Confluence</h4>
					The solution I came upon to solve the usability issue of this template was to reconstruct a simplified version of it in Confluence, T-Mobile's local page creation tool. Confluence is normally meant only for Wiki-style pages, but with a bit of creative CSS and JavaScript usage, I was able to work around that limitation and turn it into a rudimentary website editor. The limitations of the tool meant some design choices had to be simplified a bit in order to be maintained in the new version, but otherwise meant that even a non-tech savvy user would be able to edit the webpage without much issue.
